# JUNO reconstruction deep learning  framework WIP

This project summarizes the work done by L. Péron (ENS, France) supervised by S. Caillou and J. Stark (L2IT, France) in order to provide preliminary analysis to the topics of primary vertex reconstruction in JUNO using DL methods in the context of CCSN detection.

These code are meant to be used by L. Péron on the CCIN2P3. For any further informations, please contact L. Péron by mail at [lukas.peron@ens.psl.eu](mailto:lukas.peron@ens.psl.eu). No access to the training data will be provided.
